# Learning simulations with ScaFi-Alchemist

* ScaFi is an aggregate programming framework
* Alchemist is a (meta-)simulator

## Alchemist

### Conceptual model

- **Molecule**: name of a data item
- **Concentration**: value associated to a particular molecule
- **Node**: a container of molecules/reactions, living inside an environment
- **Environment**: the Alchemist abstration for the space.
    - It is a container for nodes, and it is able to tell:
  a) Where the nodes are in the space - i.e. their position
  b) How distant are two nodes
  c) Optionally, it may provide support for moving nodes
- **Linking rule**: a function of the current status of the environment that associates to each node a
  neighborhood
    - **Neighborhood**: an entity composed by a node (centre) + a set of nodes (neighbors)
- **Reaction**: any event that can change (through an **action**) the state of the environment
    - Consists of 0+ **conditions**, 1+ **actions**, and a **time distribution**
    - Conditions, time distribution, static rate, and rate equation affect the **frequency** of the reaction
- Alchemist implements an optimised version (NRM) of Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA)

So

- The **system state** depends on the configuration of molecules floating in it
- The **system evolution** depends on the kinds of chemical reactions applicable over time

Another key concept is the **dependency graph**

- Actions are outputs
- Conditions are inputs

### Running simulations

Use task configured in `build.gradle.kts`:

```bash
$ ./gradlew hello
```

Basically, all you need to do to launch a simulation (batch) is running `it.unibo.alchemist.Alchemist`
 with your simulation's descriptor. So, another approach is the following:

```bash
./gradlew fatJar # or shadowJar

java -Xmx2524m -cp "build/libs/<MYFATJAR>.jar" \
  it.unibo.alchemist.Alchemist \
  -b -var random \
  -y <path-to-yaml> -e data/20191004-test \
  -t 100 -p 1 -v &> exec.txt &
```

### Scafi

The simulation descriptor must indicate `incarnation: scafi`
 and configure a `RunScafiProgram` action
 pointing to the class of some class implementing `AggregateProgram`.

```yaml
incarnation: scafi

pools:
  - pool: &program
    - time-distribution:
        type: ExponentialTime
        parameters: [1]
      type: Event
      actions:
        - type: RunScafiProgram
          parameters: [it.unibo.casestudy.HelloWorld, 5.0] # second argument is retention time
    - program: send
```
An example ScaFi program is the following

```scala
package it.unibo.casestudy

import it.unibo.alchemist.model.implementations.molecules.SimpleMolecule
import it.unibo.alchemist.model.scafi.ScafiIncarnationForAlchemist._

class HelloWorld extends AggregateProgram with StandardSensors with Gradients {
  override def main(): Any = {
    val x = node.get[Int]("prova")
    node.put("prova2", x+1)
    classicGradient(mid==100)
  }
}
```

### Plotting

```
$ python2.7 ./plotter.py plot.yml data/ .*-g.* myg
$ ./showImgs.sh data/imgs/ myg 2 tot
```
